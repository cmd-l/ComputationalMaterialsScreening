# ComputationalMaterialsScreening
In this repository, files in crystallographic information file (cif) format of ABX<sub>3</sub> compounds are available. High-thoruput (HT) screening for  ABX<sub>3</sub> compounds were implemented using random sampling and DFT. The method to generate highly stable structures of ABX<sub>3</sub> compounds is explained in our previous work:

The full HT screening to be published shortly for the uploaded structures.
